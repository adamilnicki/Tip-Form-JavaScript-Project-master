#What You Should See
In the case of tip form calculator above, you should be able to use the calculator to enter an amount of a bill, the number of people who will split the bill, and a selection as to how the service went.
If a user forgets to add input or if the input is blank (or less than zero), feedback should be alerted to the user and then go away after 5 seconds.
During the calculation, a GIF animation should show for a couple seconds before the user's answer show up on the screen.
After about 5 seconds, the calculator should reset all forms.
